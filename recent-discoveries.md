## formattable: Create 'Formattable' Data Structures
<blockquote>This package is designed for applying formatting on vectors and data frames to make data presentation easier, richer, more flexible and hopefully convey more information.</blockquote>

### Why I like it
Can create a formatted currency type (for example) that is 'pretty' and still works like a numeric.

## styler: Non-Invasive Pretty Printing of R Code
<blockquote>The goal of styler is to provide non-invasive pretty-printing of R source code while adhering to the tidyverse formatting rules. styler can be customized to format code according to other style guides too.</blockquote>

### Why I like it
It not only straightens out your code, but it can handle comments, including roxygen comments. **Pro tip:** modify RStudio keyboard shortcuts so that ` Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A ` maps to "style selection." Use this instead of the built in ` Ctrl+Shift+A ` to "reformat code."
