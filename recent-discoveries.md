## formattable: Create 'Formattable' Data Structures
<blockquote>Provides functions to create formattable vectors and data frames. 'Formattable' vectors are printed with text formatting, and formattable data frames are printed with multiple types of formatting in HTML to improve the readability of data presented in tabular form rendered in web pages.</blockquote>

### Why I like it
Can create a formatted currency type that is 'pretty' and still works like a numeric.

## styler: Non-Invasive Pretty Printing of R Code
<blockquote>Pretty-prints R code without changing the user's formatting intent.</blockquote>

### Why I like it
It not only straightens out your code, but it can handle comments, including roxygen comments.
